What do you already know about your communication style and skills?

I know I can be a little passive and indirect when communicating, which is something I need to work on. I tend to doubt myself, and this reflects in my communication skills.


What did you learn while reading this?

I learned about the significance of communicating in a development team. This is something employers will look for, and it holds a lot of weight when applying for jobs. I also learned how to implement communication into my experience at Thinkful and how this applies to my work in the program.

What techniques or tips are you looking forward to trying during the bootcamp?

I’m looking forward to collaboration because I think it will help me learn more as opposed to going about learning on my own. Some of the soft skills learned here will apply to other areas besides web development, and it will be good to practice them while learning the skills needed in a career developing web apps.
